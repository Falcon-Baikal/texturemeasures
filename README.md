texture_measures
================

Python grey level co-occurrence matrix implementation based on Haralick's 1973 paper Textural Features for Image Classification.  

Contains a number of texture measures outlined in the paper.  Once the CooccurenceMatrixTextures class has been instantiated with an image, the various texture methods can be called to return the textural measures for the image.
